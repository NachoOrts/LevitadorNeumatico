# Special Features

For some reason, code canÂ´t handle hand position
over 67% although Ultrasonic sensor seams to be fine.

In addition, when Ball reaches over 100%, program
register its position as 65%.

Also, program is set to be always on but its possible to add a functional 
button feature if someone wants the system to be able to turn on and off.
This requieres a little tuning of the code, although most of the changes
to make are just to un-comment some lines.
